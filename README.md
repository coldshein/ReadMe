My name is Roman, and I'm an experienced developer in **React/Next, Redux Toolkit, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript.**

I have a strong knowledge of web application development and ensuring high-quality code. 

My GitHub profile showcases projects that demonstrate my skills in developing functional components, using *Redux Toolkit* to manage application state, and effectively utilizing *HTML and CSS* to create a user-friendly and attractive interface.
